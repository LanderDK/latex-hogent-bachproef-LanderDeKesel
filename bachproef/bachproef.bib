Patients with an altered thumbprint due to other causes and palmar hyperhidrosis were excluded.Fingerprint verification (pass/fail) and hand eczema severity index score.Twenty-seven percent of patients failed fingerprint verification compared with 2\\% of controls. Fingerprint verification failure was associated with a higher hand eczema severity index score (P \\&lt; .001). The main fingerprint abnormalities were fingerprint dystrophy (42.0\\%) and abnormal white lines (79.5\\%). The number of abnormal white lines was significantly higher among the patients with hand dermatitis compared with controls (P = .001). Among the patients with hand dermatitis, the odds of failing fingerprint verification with fingerprint dystrophy was 4.01. The presence of broad lines and long lines was associated with a greater odds of fingerprint verification failure (odds ratio [OR], 8.04; 95\\% CI, 3.56-18.17 and OR, 2.37; 95\\% CI, 1.31-4.27, respectively), while the presence of thin lines was protective of verification failure (OR, 0.45; 95\\% CI, 0.23-0.89).Fingerprint verification failure is a significant problem among patients with more severe hand dermatitis. It is mainly due to fingerprint dystrophy and abnormal white lines.Malaysian National Medical Research Register Identifier: NMRR-11-30-8226}},
